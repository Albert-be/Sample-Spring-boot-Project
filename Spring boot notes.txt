@SpringBootApplication::::it is combination of all 3 annotations, instead of using all these three application we can use this single annotation.
   Thats why when ever we create spring application by default spring will add this annotations

- it is combination of @SpringBootConfiguration, + @EnableAutoConfiguration, + @ComponentScan
- @SpringBootConfiguration internally uses @configuration.

 @configuration Uses:::it is used to provide the configuration or classes as java based configuration.

-There are three types of configuration we can do in spring based application
1) xml based configuration
2) java based configuration
3) Annotation Based configuration

- if we want to use java based configuration we will use @configuration.

@EnableAutoConfiguration :::::  it is basecally used to enabled the auotConfiguration calsses for our spring boot application. 
 it enables dispatcherServlet auotConfiguration Class
 
@ComponentScan ::: it is use to scan the spring component which is present in another packages. means base packages or sub packeages for the spring component.
